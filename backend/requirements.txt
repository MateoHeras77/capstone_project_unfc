# ❌ TensorFlow on Render Web Services is fragile

# Reasons:
# Huge binary (~500+ MB install)
# High RAM usage during install
# Long build time
# Needs compatible CPU features
# Often exceeds free-tier limits
# Not designed for lightweight web dynos

# ⚠️ SECOND ISSUE: Prophet ALSO heavy
# prophet pulls:
# cmdstanpy
# pystan / cmdstan
# C++ toolchain dependencies
# Large downloads during build
# This combo is brutal for PaaS builds.
